## Video Templates

Each video should follow this structure:
1. Hook (0-3 seconds): Exciting gameplay or "before/after" showcase
2. Introduction (3-8 seconds): Short intro to the mod feature being shown
3. Demonstration (8-25 seconds): Clear showcase of the modded feature in action
4. Call-to-Action (25-30 seconds): Prompt to download from ModStore

## Branding Elements

All videos should include:
- ModStore logo overlay in corner

- Consistent hashtags in captions (#ModStore #ModdedGames #GameMods)

## Performance Tracking

Track the following metrics for each video:
- Views
- Engagement rate (likes + comments + shares / views)

Update this strategy based on performance data every two weeks.
